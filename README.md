# World weather analysis with APIs and data visualization 

## Overview

This module focused on using API requests to pull data from the OpenWeather and GoogleMaps APIs
for the purpose of creating various data visualizations, including scatter plots with linear
regressions, and layered maps with markers. In addition, the module challenge used the Google
Directions API to create a travel itinerary. 

## Results

- Our vacation map with markers:

## Conclusions

Using APIs for data retrieval combined with various data visualization techniques creates unique 
possibilities for real time data analysis.
